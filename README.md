## Software

- [Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/)
  > Slic3r is free software 3D slicing engine for 3D printers. It generates G-code from 3D CAD files. Once finished, an appropriate G-code file for the production of the 3D modeled part or object is sent to the 3D printer for the manufacturing of a physical object.

- [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/)
  > The snappy web interface for your 3D printer.

- [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org)
  > OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD (computer-aided design) objects. It is a script-only based modeller that uses its own description language; parts can be previewed, but it cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view.
